.SYNOPSIS  Run the comment-triage routine locally in draft mode.
.DESCRIPTION
    Invokes Claude Code headlessly to follow docs/COMMENT-TRIAGE.md, Phases 1-3
    only (classify + dedup + write the review report). It creates/posts NOTHING —
    it just produces mcp/mcp-config/triage-report.json for you to review and
    approve later in an interactive session.

    MUST run locally: the routine drives your logged-in Chrome via the extension
    and the MCP's 127.0.0.1 bridge. Preconditions at run time:
      - Chrome open, Steam Workshop Helper extension loaded, logged into Steam
      - steam-workshop-helper MCP registered (user scope) + GITHUB_TOKEN set

    Intended to be launched by Windows Task Scheduler (see docs/SCHEDULING.md).

Follow the routine in $spec exactly. Run Phases 1 through 3 ONLY (draft mode):
classify recent comments, dedup against existing GitHub issues, and write the
review report to mcp/mcp-config/triage-report.json. Do NOT create any GitHub
issue and do NOT post any Steam reply. If Chrome is not open/logged in, write a
report noting that and stop.
